# Todo List Challenge
The Todo List Challenge is to build a simple web application that allows users to maintain a list of tasks.

## Getting started

### Development server

#### Frontend
Run `ng serve` in `web-ui` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 12.13.0 - (LTS)
- Angular CLI - 8.3.17
- Java - 11.0.5 (LTS)
- Maven - 3.6.2

## Installing

- To get `Node.js`, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/ "Nodejs.org").
- To get the Angular CLI, run `npm install -g @angular/cli`.
- Run `npm install` to install all node dependencies including [rxjs](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/). 
- To download Java, go to [oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
- To download Maven, go to [apache.org](https://maven.apache.org/)

## Running the tests

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Deployment

### Build

#### Frontend
Run `ng build` in `web-ui` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Built with
- Angular - The web framework used
- Angular CLI - The command line interface
- Angular Material - Installed via NPM, used for styling
- NPM - The package manager used
- VSCode and IntelliJ - The text-editor and IDE used for developement

## Versioning 
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.17.
This project also uses Maven [3.6.2](https://maven.apache.org/).
