# Todo List Challenge
The Todo List Challenge is to build a simple web application that allows users to maintain a list of tasks.

## Getting started

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 12.13.0 - (LTS)
- Angular CLI - 8.3.17

## Installing

- To get `Node.js`, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/ "Nodejs.org").
- To get the Angular CLI, run `npm install -g @angular/cli`.
- Run `npm install` to install all node dependencies including [rxjs](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/). 

## Running the tests

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Deployment

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Built with
